# KeepOn

According to a [PubMed study by J C Norcross and D J Vangarelli](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2980864/), only 19% of people maintain their New Year's resolutions for 2 years.
Those who kept to their resolutions were found to have significantly more motivation than their non-maintaining counterparts. 
Thus, KeepOn's goal is to help everyone stay motivated so they can complete their goals, New Year's or not.
